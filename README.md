Some of my lessons learned, strategies employed, and tools used during the search for my first developer job. YMMV.

## The Process
I had a very stable process that I employed to conduct my job search. It worked for me. It may not, as I outline it, work for you. Take the best, leave the parts that don't work for you. Hopefully, this will give you some ideas of where to start or help you identify a new path forward. Different perspectives often jar us into creativity.

## Tools
I used a variety of tools to conduct my job search and build my online footprint. You probably already know about these, but maybe I can surprise you.

## Lessons Learned
Every project, job, or process should be reviewed, dispassionately, honestly, and brutally to find what worked best and, often, what didn't work at all. The brilliance of the written word is that no hard earned lesson ever need be repeated. The sad reality of human existence is that we often ignore the written word.
