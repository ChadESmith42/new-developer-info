# Process

I treated my job search as if it were a job in iteself. I had the means to not work a 'transition' job and just focus on my search. You might not be so lucky. That's ok. Take what will work for your needs and modify the rest. What worked for me may not work for you.

## Stick To A Schedule
Treating my job search like a job was made much easier by the fact that I kept a constant schedule.
- 8:00 AM: Be at "work." In my case, I was typically sitting at Starbucks using the free wifi. Maybe for you it's your basement or your couch.
- 8:00 AM to 8:20/8:30 AM: Networking. For me, networking consisted of two parts: engaging with others and creating posts/content for my own network.
- 8:30 AM until done: Apply for open positions. Could be 10 minutes. Could be all day.
- Balance of the day to 5:00 PM Work on coding. Practice your weaknesses until you are competent.

Having a set schedule not only helped me get used to the idea of awaking at a specific time, it also provided a framework where I could plan my day. Not having a job can sometimes feel like your sailing a boat with no rudder. You have a good idea of where you want to go, but the means of getting there is a mystery. The schedule also forced me to take on the unpleasant, non-sexy, tasks: like learning new things or working on things that I'm terrible at performing.

## Networking
[Arnold Schwartzenegger once said, "There is not such thing as a self-made man."](https://youtu.be/RJsvR_gSEjg) He's right. We all have arrived exactly where we are by the work of others. When you approach your job search, it isn't going to be just you that gets the job. It's all of the people who helped you along the way. So remember that. The power of networking isn't what you can gain from it. Rather, the power of networking is what you gain from helping others. I take that approach to creating relationships in my network and it has worked extremely well for me.
1. Know who to follow. For every major city there is always a business media company that publishes a best place to work article, usually titles something like "Top 20 Places to Work in Westeros." If any of those companies sound like something you like to do, then follow the company via LinkedIn and follow their CEO.
1. Engage your network. So now that you have a few people in your network, read their content. If something is interesting, interact with the post. Leave a comment. Be active.
1. Tell a (positive) story. My content is mostly about things that I find interesting or things that I am doing that I find cool and rewarding. I don't like to generate negative content or protray myself as someone who is bitter, angry, or victimized. You can read through my content and you'll see that I'm either telling a positive story or helping someone else. I try not to be overbearing with my positivity. (No one wants to be the employee who says, "Looks like someone has a case of the Mondays.") I do try to be the employee that you want on your team: positive, engaged, passionate, and competent.
1. Help the person in front of you (if possible). As your network grows, you're going to connect with people who are in the same situation as you. You'll meet hundreds of them. My general guideline is "if someone asks for help, and it's within my power to do so, I help them." I wasn't always like this. In fact, I was very much NOT like this for far too large of a portion of my life. But people change. It will generally cost you nothing to be encouraging, make an introduction, provide a reference, collaborate on something, or share a post.

### Things to Avoid
1. Posting about how long you've been unemployed. Your potential employer could see that as a sign that you're not worth hiring since no one has hired you after six months. It's likely not true, you are worth hiring. Don't provide the ammunition for assumptions.
1. Posting the number of submitted applications. Again, it provides an invitation for your potential employer and teammates to make assumptions about your suitability on their team. If you were so great, why did you need to submit 200 applications?
1. Complaining. Seriously. Just don't. Again, no one wants to work with Milton from Office Space. I'm saying you need to swallow your frustration or ignore your anger at the process. By all means, let it out. Just not on LinkedIn or any publicly viewable social media. Confide in someone, certainly, but keep those conversations in context. They won't help you get hired.
1. Breaking the Classy Grandma Rule. We all have said or done things that we wouldn't say or do in front of our grandmother (or insert any classy person you respect). If you wouldn't utter it in front of your grandmother, don't post it. This rule also works well in the workplace.

## Track your efforts
Use some system, whether it's a spreadsheet, a piece of paper, or creating your own app, to track your applications. I captured the company name, position title, any position reference numbers, date of application, url of ATS, username/password used, and a link to the Google Doc version of my submitted resume. I also created a #tag and folder for all application related emails in my Gmail account. This allowed me to quickly search for emails related to my job search and ensure that nothing slipped through the cracks.

## Follow Up
If like most people, you get nervous talking to people on the phone, try these two techniques: 1) create a script of your initial greeting and contact, and 2) role-play with a friend. 

### A script is just a template for you to use until you get comfortable.

> Good morning/afternoon, my name is Chad Smith. I'm contacting you in regards to my application for your Software Engineer posting. I would appreciate just a few minutes of your time to discuss my application.

Notice I didn't ask if they had time to discuss my application. Asking a yes/no question invites the person to say no. So don't ask. If the response is, "I don't really have time right now." Just ask, "I understand you're very busy, (use the person's name, if known). When would be a good time for us to discuss my application?" 

Using the person's name makes this personal to them and increases your likeability. By asking for them to define a specific time, you place the onus on them to agree to it and provide a date and time to discuss your application. Very few people will say, "I don't have time." or "I don't typically discuss applications unless we are moving forward with the application." But if it happens, you can respond by acknowledging that it's probably a good policy and ask them to clarify where the company is in the process of filling the vacany. You may not get any insight into your application, but maybe you can leave with some information about the status of the job.

## Practice Coding
My personal weakness was Javascript. I had not spent much time diving into JS during my coding bootcamp experience. So I decided to tackle some responsive web page features by using pure JS. At the time, I had read many articles about companies getting away from jQuery. Even if that isn't the case, I believe that if you can code something in pure JS, you'll be just fine with whatever variations are slapped on top.

### Build useful products
You should focus on building things that companies need and use frequently. Does that mean you can't build a classic Snake Game or a Memory Game? Not at all, just ensure that your portfolio has a good mix of functional products and fun products. Unless of course, you're targeting a game developer job. Then by all means, let's see your Doom clone.

### Complete the README.md on your repo
Nowhere are you required to complete the README. In fact, most of my projects don't have one other than the boilerplate README generated by a framework CLI command. Let's be honest. Most code is not that impressive. The README provides you with an opportunity to speak directly to your users and potential employers. Talk about why you made the project, what was difficult, or provide some insight into your solution for the hard parts of your project.
