# Tools

## Display your code

1. **GitHub**. Duh, right? Be sure that you also explore the "profile hack" and create a good README.md for your profile. Let people (potential employers) know what you are working on, what types of technology you are working with, and how you are adding good things to the world (via your code, or otherwise). Paid and free accounts.

1. **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)** As of this writing (08 October 2020) GitHub Codespaces is in private beta. Once it goes live, it will be a paid service. This service provides a cloud IDE tied to a GitHub repo. This means, you can literally code anywhere, without having to have a powerhouse dev computer. As part of the beta, I've been using my Chromebook (a modified Lenovo IdeaPad), which I lack the patience to install VS Code. It's really awesome.

1. **[Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com)**. Stackblitz is awesome for displaying your work as the finished product, without the cost of having to acquire domains, hosting, servers, etc. You can share a live version of your projects, which is awesome. You can also link up your GitHub with Stackblitz to centralize your code. Paid and free accounts.

1. **[CodePen](https://codepen.io)**. CodePen is another online IDE, but it is more for single page applications that just use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The editor has a limited linter and error checker. Paid and free accounts.

1. **[Bit](https://bit.dev/)**. Bit is a repository for sharing components. You'll find a wide assortment of React, Angular, and Vue projects. Not only is this a way to get other people using your code, it's also a way to see what other developers are doing and how they tackled common problems. Paid and free accounts. (This one is a bit pricey at $35.00/month.)

## Tools
The biggest problem I faced as a new developer was finding data for my projects, without having to spend hours creating Matrix-like realism of fake data. Some of these tools will help you streamline that process.

1. **[Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com)**. Mockaroo provides you with a simple method of mocking an API service for your backend. You can create custom schema and even upload the generated data so you have a consistent dataset for development and testing. ProTip: Remember that an endpoint isn't your database, just the objects you need from the db. Paid and free accounts.

1. **[QuickType](https://app.quicktype.io/)**. QuickType provides you with tools to create data models from API endpoints. Paste your JSON into the interface, select your language, and QuickType returns classes/models for that data. There are some tricky behaviors that QuickType uses to avoid name conflicts. So inspect the results be using. Free.

1. **[Swagger](https://swagger.io)**. Another method for developing APIs. Paid and free accounts.

1. **[TextureJS](https://riccardoscalco.it/textures/)**. 

## Information Resources
I'm an Angular developer, with a smattering of C# experience. So most of my tools are tilted more towards that need.

1. **[Stack Overflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com)**. Another "duh" moment. Still, I do recommend completing your profile. Adding details and links. Engage with the community.

1. **[Dan Wahlin](https://flipboard.com/@dwahlin)** maintains about 13 (as of 08 October 2020) magazines on Flipbook. These are basically curated article aggregators. Dan provides an amazing amount of information that is high quality and also relevant to the newest trends in each platform or framework.

1. **[InDepth](https://indepth.dev/)**. This is a multiple-language/framework community. You'll find articles related to your specific favorite flavor of code.

1. **[PluralSight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/)**. This is a subscription service for online learning. There are many like it. There are many good ones that are free. I like PluralSight because of the quality of instruction, the affordable price, and the other tools available exclusively on PluralSight. For example, PluralSight provides Skills IQ Tests. These are very good indicators of your skill level in a particular aspect of development. I've established Skill IQs for Angular, TypeScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. PluralSight provides a public facing profile, where you can showcase your "education" and skill levels. The site also enables you to export your Skill IQ results to Stack Overflow. If you look at my Stack Overflow profile's Developer Story, you'll see my Skill IQ results on the timeline. PluralSight also has many developer conferences available, so you can still see all of the presentations from the industry experts. Paid accounts, some free content.

1. **[The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](https://javascript.info)**. This is the best JavaScript reference I've found. The examples are specific and relevant to real coding problems you will face. Best of all, it's free!

1. **[StyleGuides.io](http://styleguides.io/)**. This site has examples and tools to help you build a good style guide for your project. Sometimes seeing how brands set standards for design can help you find your own style. Or just copy one. Whichever.

1. **[CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/css-style-guides/)**. This is a great resource for finding guides on using CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox. There are tons of other guides and resources to develop your CSS skills.

1. **[On undoing, fixing, or removing commits in git](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html)**. This is a cool, choose your own adventure guide to Git. This has saved me a few times when I made some mistakes.
